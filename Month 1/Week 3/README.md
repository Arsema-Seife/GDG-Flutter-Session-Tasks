# Week 3 

## Overview
In Week 3, we studied Dart collections and learned how to use them to
store, organize, and manage data efficiently. The focus was on List,
Set, and Map, along with Dart null safety to handle nullable values
safely and avoid runtime errors.

## Topics Covered
- List in Dart
- Set in Dart
- Map in Dart
- Differences between List, Set, and Map
- Removing duplicates using Set
- Key-value storage using Map
- Set operations (difference and intersection)
- Dart null safety basics
- Using stdin for user input

## Tasks Completed This Week

### Task 1: Vocabulary Tracker (Map)
- Created a Map to store words as keys and their definitions as values
- Added at least 10 vocabulary words
- Printed all words with their meanings in a formatted way
- Allowed searching for a word
- Displayed a message when a word was not found
- Implemented extra features:
  - Delete a word
  - Count total words learned
  - Display words in alphabetical order

### Task 2: Event Guest List (Set & Null Safety)
- Created a Set of invited students
- Created a Set of confirmed students with nullable values
- Safely removed null values using Dart null safety
- Printed total invited and total confirmed students
- Found students who did not confirm attendance using set difference
- Identified students who confirmed but were not invited (party crashers)
- Used stdin to accept user input for confirmation
- Displayed appropriate messages when all guests confirmed

## Key Learnings
- List allows duplicate values and preserves order
- Set stores only unique values and supports set operations
- Map stores data as key-value pairs
- Null safety prevents errors caused by null values
- Set difference helps identify missing and extra data

## Tools & Language
- Dart programming language
- dart:io for input and output

## Outcome
By the end of Week 3, we were able to apply Dart collections and null
safety concepts to real-world scenarios using simple and structured
programs.
