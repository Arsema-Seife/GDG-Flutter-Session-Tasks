# Hello Flutter

## Overview
This is my first Flutter application. It demonstrates the basics of Flutter widgets, layouts, and styling. 
The app displays a welcome message at the top and a short description centered on the screen.
We also modified text properties like font size and color.

## Widget Tree (Horizontal Format)
`MyApp (StatelessWidget) → MaterialApp → HomePage (StatelessWidget) → Scaffold → [AppBar → Text('Welcome to Flutter'), Body → Center → Text('This is my first Flutter app', fontSize:24, color:Colors.green)]`

## Features Implemented
- AppBar with title: **“Welcome to Flutter”**
- Centered description text: **“This is my first Flutter app”**
- Modified **text size** and **color**
- StatelessWidget usage for home page and main app
- Debug banner disabled for clean UI
